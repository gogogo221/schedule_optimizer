# schedule_generator

## problem
Selecting courses is very painful because students have to navigate between the course catalog to see what courses are available, Rate My Professor, and have a calendar to check for any schedule conflicts. 

##goal
The goal of this tool is to allow students to input the courses they need to take, the number of units they are willing to take next semester, and their requirements for each class (minimum Rate my Professor Score, availability, minimum course times, etc...) and output course schedule proposals fitting their needs.
